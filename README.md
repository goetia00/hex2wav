# hex2wav
Created by Marcel Gerardino <skeptiker@sentineldr.com>

It may be that I'm bored but while disassembling some binaries I realized hex is perfect to turn into ABC musical
notation. Hex lacks g but has 9 which ironically is the only digit not used in music, and hell, it looks a lot like g.

Requires PySynth https://mdoege.github.io/PySynth/

If there is a problem, you fix it.

usage: python hex2wav file -b --bytes bytes -o --offset offset
